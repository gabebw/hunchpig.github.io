# This is the verbose show description, up to 4,000 char long
summary: Ian and Matt answer life's big questions, like the meaning of
  extraordinary, why Ian has a cat, zero-based vs. one-based numbering, time
  travel, who should be considered Americans, whether or not we have free will,
  designing in the Bauhaus style with cardboard boxes, the etymology of
  pigeonholing, virtual reality, virtual empathy, attempting to be more
  deliberate, lacking a filter, and playing Descent.
